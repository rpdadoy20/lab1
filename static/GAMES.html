<pre>I'm not really a games but when I tried playing Mobile Legends using my phone I suddenly got
hooked up because it is fun to play it with your friends. This game is also fun even if you play without 
your friends because you can always play with other random players. I play this games whenever I have a 
free time.</pre>
